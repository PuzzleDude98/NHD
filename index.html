  <p class='text-center'>ELIZA was a computer therapist created by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT in 1964, and it was fundamental in creating the chatbots we know today.
    ELIZA was one of the firsts of its kinds, computers that could emulate human connection and interaction. It tremendously impacted the fields of computing,
    AI, and society in general. It created a landscape ready for the chatbots we see everywhere today. 
    ELIZA and Joseph was shaped by the experiences that Joseph had as an immigrant from
    Nazi Germany in the 1930â€™s. After creating ELIZA and seeing what it would do, he started to speak out against AI and computers in general. </p>

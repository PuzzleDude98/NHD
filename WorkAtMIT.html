    Joseph Weizenbaum was the major person involved in the build up to ELIZA, along with his students at MIT.
    <br>Joseph Weizenbaum had to create the MAD-Slip language in order to program ELIZA, and he got hired at MIT in 1964, 
    <br>causing him to work on its infrastructure. People were interested in this because of its potential. 
    <br>ELIZA was one of the first turing-complete machines, and it opened the floodgates for an AI revolution and the proliferation of chatbots.
    <br>ELIZA also caused people to use chatbots more, instead of customer support agents, resulting in what we have today.

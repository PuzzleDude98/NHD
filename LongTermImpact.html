</div>
<p class= 'text-center'>Today, AI is used everywhere. From the new technology of self driving cars, to personal assistants, to youtube. 
    We dont have just basic AI like ELIZA that shows an essence of human speech, we have other AI that are more, well, artifically intelegent.
    We have computers that can learn from mistakes. We have computers that can predict human actions, or weather. 
    Josephs' work led to more and more advanced AI that helps us daily.</p>
<p class= 'text-center'>Ever scrolled down youtube and saw lots of videos that looked just like things you would watch? 
    An AI predicted that you would like them. Ever ask siri to tell you a joke? 
    Siri is also a chatbot, like ELIZA but more advanced! Even some of the ads you see on websites or apps or 
    videos are selected with AI to fit what you might want. AI is used everywhere!</p>

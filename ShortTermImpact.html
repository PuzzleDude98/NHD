</div>
<p class= 'text-center'>After ELIZA was created, people started using it a lot. They began to develop bonds with this computer program.
    Weizenbaum was worried. He didnt think it was possible that a computer could act like a human. To see people developing
    these relationships and talking so openly about very personal things worried him.</p>
<p class= 'text-center'>Weizenbaum wrote a book about computers acting like humans and how we should be careful with AI. 
    His negative opinion ostricized him from the AI community. He eventually moved back to germany, 
    and started giving talkes about the dangers of computers.</p>

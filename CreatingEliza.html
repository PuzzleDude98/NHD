  <p class='text-center'>ELIZA was an early chatbot. It was created at MIT in 1964-1965.
    It was named ELIZA after Eliza Doolittle, from the musical <i> My Fair Lady</i>.

  <p class='text-center'>At the time, Joseph Weizenbaum was a visiting proffessor at MIT, and ELIZA was his side project.
    ELIZA was mad in the MAD-SLIP programming languege for the IBM 7094, and it was an expiriment with human interaction. It was 
    meant to simulate a Rogerian Phsycotherapist. To communicate with ELIZA, you simply had to input into it a natural sentence with punctuation and such. 
    The only thing that as off-limits was the question mark, becuase it caused an error on the system that ELIZA was being run on.

  <p class='text-center'>When people interacted with ELIZA, they often got into deep conversations with it. 
    It was though to be truly intelligent, in the way only living, breathing humans could be.
    They felt like ELIZA knew what they said and was a real phsycotherapist. However, this was just an illusion.
  ELIZA was simply programmed to restate whatever words you said in a different manner, and it did so with several 
  key-response pairs. When a key was detected in a users input, it would give a response that corresponded to that key.</p>

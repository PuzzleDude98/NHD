  <h1 class='text-center'> Creating Eliza</h1>
</div>
  
  <p1 class='text-center'>Eliza was an early chatbot. It was created at MIT in 1964-1965.
    It was named ELIZA after Eliza Doolittle, from the musical <i> My Fair Lady</i>.

  <p1 class='text-center'>At the time, Joseph Weizenbaum was a visiting proffessor at MIT, and ELIZA was his side project.
    ELIZA was mad in the MAD-SLIP programming languege, and it was an expiriment with human interaction. It was 
    meant to simulate a Rogerian Phsycotherapist.

  <p1 class='text-center'>When people interacted with ELIZA, they often got into deep conversations with it.
    They felt like ELIZA knew what they said and was a real phsycotherapist. However, this was just an illusion.
  ELIZA was simply programmed to restate whaetver words you said in a different manner, and it did so with several 
  key-response pair. When the key was detected in a users input, it would give a response that corresponded to that key.</p1>
